CW2 - Snake Game

1. Yaml file: https://python.land/data-processing/python-yaml
- Yaml file, just the ideology is learned from here, but implementation is purely from scratch.

2. Snake game environment: https://github.com/SumitJainUTD/pytorch-ann-snake-game-ai
- Snake environment is taken from here, as per guidelines implemented DQN.py(agent) from scratch.
- Also, action selection used in above repository is of e-greedy, whereas in our code we used other exploration strategies.
- Some of the things are same everywhere else, for instance, creating a neural network follows the same code pattern in every code repository.

- This is where Boltzmann softmax inspiration taken from, referred other source to code it as well.
